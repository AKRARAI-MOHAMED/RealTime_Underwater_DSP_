# RealTime_Underwater_DSP_

This project is a part of a bigger project, intended to design and implement an autonomous embedded system composed of Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network. Our project consisted on implementing acoustic signals digital processing techniques for underwater communications.

## First phase:

At the beginning I performed a study on the probability of detection(Pd) for drone reciever, to determine which technique to use in order to maximise the Pd. finding the perfect technique that has maximum Pd, will help us determine what the transmitter signal should look like, as well as the receiver filter.

After a lot of research we decided to choose only two transmitter signal techniques for our study:

first is  : Linear Frequency Modulation
Second is : Pure tone pulse
